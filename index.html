// Javascript is a synchronous programming language but we can also execute the code asynchronously by following the following methods

// Lets start with synchronous example

count = 0;
setTimeout(function(){

	count = count + 1;
});
console.log(count);  // It is showing 0 because javascript does not wait previous statements.


// Lets start with Asynchronous example

	setTimeout(function(){

	count = count + 1;
